When selecting more boxes of the same type on the desktop, Ferda should enable
more actions that are common to the boxes (for instance creating the same 
modules for interaction).

In the Attribute frequency module, the categories for intervals should be sorted
not only alphabetically, but also accorting to the boundaries of the intervals.

Functionallity for creating copy of a desktop should be added.

Ferda should have icons for all the boxes.

Better layout - for example a method of anchoring boxes. The user selects one
box, then moves it and all the boxes connected to this boxes are moving with
the box and their distances are increasing.

A list of recently opened projects should be available.

Better dynamic help - now the help displays only the hint and the type of the
selected box. In the future, it should contain hint also for the sockets and
properties of the box.
