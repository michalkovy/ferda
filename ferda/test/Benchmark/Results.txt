This file should include results of tests run on different machines with different configuration.

How to fill this file:
0) Make your machine idle (close all processes which you do not need) and stable at performance (see ***)
1) Execute "nant" in the Benchmark directory
2) Copy down information from "YourLastResult.txt" file which has been created in the directory
3) Fill in info about your machine (machine name should mach the name of machine in the "YourLastResult.txt" file)
(4) Execute "nant -t:mono-2.0" in the Benchmark directory)
(5) Copy down information from "YourLastResult.txt" file which has been created in the directory)

*** How to make computer stable in performace
If you have laptop with SpeedStep technology and the processor is so much hot, the computer decreases performance
of the CPU. It discvalifies the results, because some numbers are with higher performance of the CPU then other.
So let me describe how to set the CPU to the lowest performance from beginning:
1) In Control Panel -> Power options on the "Power Schemas" tab select the "Max Battery" schema
2) Unplug laptop from the electricity
3) In the machine description include operating frequency. You can use for the determination of the frequency
the Intel Frequency ID utility (http://support.intel.com/support/processors/tools/frequencyid/), but it may work incorrectly
in some situations
