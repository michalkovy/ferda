
   HOW TO ADD FRONTEND ADDIN

1. How has result look like
In bin folder in project directory there is AddIns folder. In this folder are FrontEnd AddIns. Every AddIn is .NET library with extension ".dll". If the name of library is <name>.dll then in library must be class Ferda.FrontEnd.AddIns.<name>.Main which implements interface Ferda.FrontEnd.AddIns.IAddInMain (or extends something what implements that interface - for example Ferda.FrontEnd.AddIns.AbstractMain) which you can find in library FrontEndAddInHelper.dll.

2. What can AddIn use for interaction with FrontEnd
It can use Ferda.FrontEnd.AddIns.IOwnerOfAddIn interface which receives your Ferda.FrontEnd.AddIns.IAddInMain implementation to OwnerOfAddIn property.

3. Creation of AddIn inside Ferda sources (for Ferda code maintainers)
	1) create new directory in src/FrontEnd/AddIns which has the same name as name of your AddIn - <name>
	2) add in this directory class Ferda.FrontEnd.AddIns.<name>.Main which extends Ferda.FrontEnd.AddIns.AbstractMain
	3) implement abstract properties from AbstractMain class in your main
	4) implement your AddIn
	5) add to src/FrontEnd/AddIns/default.build procedure of building your AddIn. It has to create library <name>.dll in bin/AddIns
