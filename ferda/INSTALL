	HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL WITHOUT INSTALLER FERDA ON YOUR WINDOWS SYSTEM 

Please go through these steps to successfully install ferda on your system:

1) Install .NET 2 SDK or Visual Studio 2005 or newer
2) Install NAnt, supported version is 0.85 and newer (nant.sourceforge.net)
3) Install Ice (www.zeroc.com)
4) Install Java JDK (for modules written in Java)
5) Set PATH environment variable to have Ice bin directory, NAnt bin directory, Java JDK bin and the .NET 2 SDK bin directory in it.
6] Execute command line (cmd) which administrator rights
7) Run "nant fullinstall" in the ferda's root directory
You can specify these options in this step:
-D:ice.dir=ICEPATH	path to Ice directory, if not C:\Ice-3.2.1
-D:optimize=true		optimize generated code
-D:debug=None				do not create debug symbols

Now you have created and installed Ferda to bin directory.

There are other nant build targets:
nant src					compile Ferda
nant config				config Ferda
nant uninstall		uninstall Ferda
nant clean				clean files created with compilation
nant install			install compiled and configured Ferda
nant refresh			uninstall, clean, compile, installs Ferda and runs tests
nant debugsrc			like "nant src but" creates version for debuggin on side of Modules
nant debugrefresh	like "nant refresh" but creates version for debuggin on side of Modules
nant debuginstall like "nant install" but creates version for debuggin on side of Modules

Version for debugging
If you create Ferda with commans "nant debug...", you have to execute modules application
yourselves before running Ferda. So you can execute that in a debugger.

To compile an installer, update to the latest subversion version and create a directory
in the Ferda subversion root, named ThirdParty. Copy Ice into that directory and name it
"ice". Now you can compile Ferda installer with command "nant installer". (You have to
have NSIS installed)

To generate documentation:
1) XSLT needs to be installed and in PATH
2) XEP needs to be installed and in PATH (for generation of PDF files)

nant doc target generates Ferda documentation.
