            About Ferda DataMiner</h1>
        <p>
            Ferda is a user friendly data mining tool. It is a modular distributed multiplatform
            framework based on Internet Communications Engine. Ferda is very powerful in working
            with association rules.</p>
        <p>
            The goal of project Ferda was to create an application which will replace the current
            user environment for the data mining system LISp-Miner by a new, more visually and
            user friendly working environment. Ferda brings in the conception of data mining
            task as the record of the function using visual objects – boxes. Boxes have their
            parameters and evaluate their functions based on the values of the parameters. The
            program is modular and is designed to make the addition of new boxes easy. We have
            created the environment that organizes and simplifies user interaction with the
            LISp-Miner system and offers further possibilities for research and extensions.</p>
