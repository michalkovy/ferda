  <abstract>
    <para>
      This document describes the user interface of the data mining system
      Ferda DataMiner. It defines the parts of working environment and describes
      how user works with these parts.
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>Dockable working environment</title>
    <para>
      All the components (parts of the working environment) except of the 
      main application menu and the Toolbar are movable across the 
      working space by the means of the docking mechanism. The program has
      a preset setting of the components (Archive and New Box on the left, 
      Properties and Context Help on the right). However, user can dock the 
      components freely. The docking mechanism is a standard used mainly in
      the user environment of the development tools (MS Visual Studio etc.)
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>Box - module from the view of the user</title>
    <para>
      The project team wanted orginaly to use the word "module" for a graphical
      element of the user environment. However the word is used in many different
      context, so we decided to name the graphical element of the visual programming
      otherwise - a box.
    </para>
    <para>
      We distinguish between 4 terms in the box terminology: box category, box type,
      box name and box. We use an example to illustrate the differences of the
      terminology. We have the 4ft task box. A box is one particular 
      instance of the box type 4ft task. It is defined by its parameters
      (antecedent, succedent, quantifiers...). User can name this box or he
      can use the standard name provided by the system. The box type 4ft task
      is an identifier of all instances of 4ft tasks. Finally, the box category in this
      case would be 4ft-Miner category, which besides the task contains a set 
      of quantifiers specific for the 4ft task. 
    </para>
    <para>
      For the user, box is a graphical object, that can be used on the desktop. Box is
      represented by icon, name and set of properties, that the user can change. Furthermore,
      it contains sockets, where other boxes can be connected. This connection will
      be represented on the desktop by an arrow from the connected box into the socket.
      Each box type has a predefined list of actions, which can be used with the box instances
      of this type.
    </para>
    <para>
      A box type can also contain Modules for interaction. Module for interaction means executing
      an action of the box, which is provided by other module that the box itself. Modules for
      interaction can be dialogs, tables, graphs...
    </para>
    <para>
      Boxes asking for creation is a concept, that should simplify the visual data mining in Ferda. A
      box can offer a list of boxes in its context menu or in the main application menu. When a
      user clicks on the box (in the menu), the clicked box is created, and the properties and connections are
      properly set. We should create a demonstrative example to show how it works. Let us have a 
      <emphasis>Database</emphasis> box. This box offers to create a <emphasis>Data matrix</emphasis> box.
      There is a list of data matrices names in the database in the context menu of the 
      <emphasis>Database</emphasis> box under the <emphasis>Boxes asking for creation</emphasis> item
      (this works only when there the <emphasis>Database</emphasis> box has a valid ODBC 
      connection string set).
      When the user clicks on one of the names of data matrices, a new <emphasis>Data matrix</emphasis>
      box will be created besides the <emphasis>Database</emphasis>. Moreover, the 
      <emphasis>Database</emphasis> box will be connected to the newly created
      <emphasis>Data Matrix</emphasis> box.
    </para>
    <para>
      A box contains a full information what is connected inside the box, even
      if the user does not see it on the desktop (in Ferda's visual data mining it
      means the part of the graph that leads to the box "from the left"). User
      can know this information with the aid of packing and unpacking mechanism,
      which is provided by the desktop (more in the desktop section).

      <title>Menu</title>
      <simpara>
        Application has a menu that provides the most important functionality.
        The menu consists of a static part and a dynamic part. The static part
        calls functions that manage the whole application. The dynamic part is
        dependent on the box (boxes) selected on the desktop or in the archive.

            desktops.

        Toolbar is an alternative for the main application menu and the

      <title>Archive</title>
      <para>
        The aim of archive is to simplify the process of data mining for the user.
        All boxes that have been created by the user are stored in the archive.
        User can thus easily return to previous practices and reuse them. 
        With initial setting, the archive is located on the left side of user
        environment.
      </para>
      <para>
        The archive component consists of four parts. The first part is a combo-box
        with all the box categories that the user used in the project. 
        The second part is also a combo-box, but contains the box types that user 
        used in the project
        The third part is
        a .NET TreeView component for showing the archive. Each item in the archive
        is represented by an icon and a name. The fourth part contains 2 buttons for
        interpretation of unpacking of the archive - along or against the direction
        of connections.

                or (and) selecting the box type in the second combo-box.
                System shows in the TreeView all boxes of that type that are

                The archive supports browsing against and along the connection
                direction. The 2 buttons at the bottom of the archive aid to
                distinguish this direction. The first button represents browsing
                along the connection direction, the other one against. When user
                selects one of the buttons, the other one deselects automatically.
                Therefore it is clear in which direction to unpack. After a change
                of direction archive is reset into the initial position: all
                boxes of type selected in the combo-box are displayed.

                along and against the connection direction.
                In case of outgoing arrows (along the connection direction)
                user clicks on the cross(on the left)
                by the box in the TreeView. Afterwards the component unpacks all the

      <para>
        A box can have many properties and they can belong to several groups. 
        The property grid component shows all the visible properties of the
        box and sorts them into property groups.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the user selects more than one box on the desktop, there are properties
        displayed in the property grid that have all the boxes in common. If the 
        properties share also the same value, the value is displayed 
        (otherwise a default value for the type of the property is used). If user
        set some of the common properties, the value is automatically set into
        all the selected boxes.
      </para>
      <para>
        There is a special group of properties in the property grid called
        <emphasis>Visible sockets</emphasis>. For each normal writable property
        of the socket, there is one Boolean property in the <emphasis>Visible 
        sockets</emphasis> group, implicitly set to <emphasis>false</emphasis>.
        If the user sets this property to <emphasis>true</emphasis>, a new
        socket is created on the desktop for the selected box. This socket
        represents this property. Afterwards, the property can be set only
        at the desktop by connecting a box into the socket and it is read-only
        in the property grid. Socket can be removed after resetting the value
        of the property in the <emphasis>Visible sockets</emphasis> to <emphasis>
        false</emphasis>.

                Visual connecting of the boxes on the desktop is the most

                all, user places the mouse on the output connector of the
                box he wishes to connect. Than the system shows him the handle
                on the socket and then the user left clicks on the handle, 
                with the left mouse button clicked he moves with the mouse
                onto the socket of the box, he wishes to connect. System 
                checks the type consistency of the connection. If it is not
                correct, it generates an error message, otherwise it creates
                a new connection.

                Cloning of the box means creating a new instance of the box type
                in the archive. The new box inherits all the properties and
                input connections of the cloned old box. However, it will be a
                new independent object in the archive (and in the whole project).
                User clones the box by clicking on the <emphasis>Clone</emphasis>
                item in the context menu. System then creates and displays the
                new box in the archive. This can be done also
                by pressing <emphasis>Ctrl+E</emphasis> key.

              <para>
                Sometimes it is important for the user to get a quick overview
                of the box and its neighborhood, that cannot be gotten from the
                desktop or property grid. For these purposes, there is a 
                <emphasis>Localize in archive</emphasis> context menu action.
                System reacts by setting the TreeView archive part into the 
                basic position that corresponds to the box type of the selected
                box. (see Archive, Vertical Archive browsing). The system also
                selects the box in the archive. User can evoke this action also
                with the <emphasis>Ctrl+H</emphasis> key.

                deleting boxes from the archive) deleting the visual representation
                from the focused desktop. This can be used when the desktop
                is overfilled with boxes and the user can erase some boxes.
                User can delete the boxes from desktop by clicking on <emphasis>Delete

                information connected to the box. User deletes the box by
                clicking on the <emphasis>Delete from archive</emphasis>
                item in the context menu. System then asks the user if he
                wants really to delete the box and deletes it on approval.
                This can be done also
                by pressing <emphasis>Shift+Del</emphasis> key.
