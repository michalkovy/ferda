        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            Welcome to Edit fuzzy categories module. This is a module designed for manual
            creating and editing of fuzzy categories, that have trapezoidal shape.

        <para>
            The figure below shows the module. The upper part is a graph showing the 
            existing fuzzy categories. In the lower part, there are text boxes and 
            buttons to manipulate with the fuzzy categories. In the lower right corner,
            there is a list of existing fuzzy categories.

        <title>Graph of the fuzzy categories</title>
        <para>
            The displayed graph shows all the fuzzy categories defined by the module. 
            A 3D view was chosen, because it looked better than the 2D one. If there is
            no fuzzy category, the axis do not have any scales. This is a technical
            limitation of the underlying graphing library. The minimal and maxima values
            of the attributes is displayed in the text area above the graph. 
            The scales appear, when there exist at least one fuzzy category.  
        </para>
        <para>
            The axes are scaled according to the minimal and maximal values of the 
            attribute. The legend appears, if there are at least two fuzzy categories.

            <title>Adding a fuzzy category</title>
            <para>
               If the user wants to add a fuzzy category, (s)he adds required information
               about the category- name of the category and the A, B, C and D values of
               the trapezoid. There are several constraints that the trapezoid must fulfill:
               <itemizedlist>
                   <listitem>
                       <simpara>
                           The condition A &lt; D &lt; C &lt; B in order to get a proper
                           trapezoid.
                       </simpara>
                   </listitem>
                   <listitem>
                       <simpara>
                           The A value must be less than maximal value of the attribute
                       </simpara>
                   </listitem>
                   <listitem>
                       <simpara>
                           The B value must be greater than maximal value of the attribute
                       </simpara>
                   </listitem>
                   <listitem>
                       <simpara>
                           The name of the fuzzy category has to be unique.
                       </simpara>
                   </listitem>
               </itemizedlist>
               If these are fullfilled, after clicking on the "Add fuzzy category" button, 
               the fuzzy category is added. 
            </para>

        <section>
            <title>Removing a fuzzy category</title>
            <para>
                In order to remove a fuzzy category, user selects a category from the
                list of categories and then clicks to "Remove fuzzy category".
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Editing a fuzzy category</title>
            <para>
                The user needs to select a fuzzy category to be edited from the 
                list of categores. After clicking on "Edit fuzzy category", the details
                of the fuzzy category are displayed in the corresponding text boxes. 
                After editing, the button "Save fuzzy category" should be clicked. Again
                constraints from adding fuzzy categories (previous text) must be fullfilled.
            </para>
            <para>
                If the user edits the category and clicks on "Add fuzzy category" instead,
                a new category is created. In order to do this, the name of the category
                must be different from the name of the edited categories and also some of
                the values need to be different. 
            </para>

            <para>
                After the process of creation and editing of fuzzy categories, user should
                click on "OK" button in order to save categories and sending the information
                back to the Attribute with fuzzy categories box.
