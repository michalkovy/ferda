\section{Related Work} \label{RelatedWork}

One of the most known methods for graphical comparison of classification functions are \emph{ROC curves} \cite{Faw}. The theory dealing with ROC curves originates from construction of \emph{confusion matrices}, which are similar to \emph{4ft-tables} presented in this paper. The theory gives meaning to points in the ROC space, to ROC curves and the area under ROC curves. 

However, the curves are used mainly for measuring quality of classification functions. In our approach, we are not interested in the fact, how good the evaluation functions were if used as classifiers. Therefore, the ROC curves are not object of our interest.
