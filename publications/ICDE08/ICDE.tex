\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

Association rules mining is an important technique widely used in the
KDD community \cite{KDNuggets}. The classical algorithm for association rules 
mining, \emph{apriori} \cite{Agrawal2} is restricted to mining over a single 
relation composed of a set of binary attributes. 

There are some approaches that extend the classical algorithm with ability
of mining over multiple relations. Dehaspe and De Raedt\cite{Warmr} use 
techniques from the field of inductive logical programming used in their 
\emph{WARMR} algorithm. It is suitable for complex structure of relations 
and had several successful applications. Other approach \cite{Connection}
adapts \emph{support} and \emph{confidence} measures and calculates them on
tables without joining them. These approaches are based on the \emph{apriori}
algorithm.

There are also approaches to extend expressing power of association rules.
By far the most significant work in this field is the ongoing research of
the GUHA method \cite{GUHA1, GUHA2}. GUHA is the an original method of 
exploratory data analysis that is nowadays researched mainly in context of
generalizing association rules \cite{Rauch2, Alternative}. Attemts to
use generalized association rules also for multirelational data were made
\cite{Rauch1, Karban}. 
Non-relational GUHA procedures work with single data table. 
Working with multirelational rules requires having more than one data table
in relation, which better reflects real-world situations.
For now, the star-scheme\footnote{One master table and several detail tables.}
technique of the database has been considered.
Relational approach works with the term \emph{virtual attribute}.
Its values are computed from detail data tables and act as attribute for the main
data table. There are two types of 
\emph{virtual attributes} presented: SQL transformation or generalized
association rule mined above the detail table\footnote{To be explained
later}. The latter cannot be obtained by any of the methods based on 
\emph{apriori} algorithm. 

Although the theory for multirelational extensions of the GUHA association
mining is well developed, until now there was a lack of successful 
implementation. In our Ferda environment, we implemented the multirelational
extensions of GUHA generalized association rules and conducted some very
useful experiments to show advisability of these rules. The aim of this paper
is to present multirelational association rules based on \emph{virtual attributes}
and to demonstrate their implementation in the Ferda system. 

Paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{section:principles} explains in brief
the principles of multirelational association mining with \emph{virtual attributes}.
Section \ref{section:ferda} describes the demonstrated system. Section 
\ref{section:features} states the features of the system to be demonstrated
and section \ref{section:conclusion} concludes the paper. 

\section{Principles of Multirelational Association mining}
\label{section:principles}

\subsection{Generalized Association Rules}
\label{section:generalized}
Let us first explain the generalized association rules in sense of GUHA method
\cite{Rauch1,Rauch2,Alternative}\footnote{For simplicity, we focus only on 
\emph{unconditional rules}. More on \emph{conditional rules} can be found in 
\cite{Rauch2}.}. Generalized association rules mined by procedure 4FT \cite{Alternative}
extend the ``classical'' association rules from \emph{apriori} procedure
X$\rightarrow$Y, where X and Y are sets of items, in two ways. 

The first way is to
enable \emph{Boolean attributes} for antecedent and consequent. \emph{Boolean attributes}
are recursive structures that enable conjunctions, disjunctions and negations of
combinations of individual items. Details can be found in \cite{Ralbovsky}.

The second way is to enable expressing more general kind of dependency between 
antecedent and consequent then \emph{confidence} and \emph{support}. We call these 
dependencies \emph{4ft-quantifiers}. The generalized association rule can be written
in form \mbox{$\varphi \approx \psi$}, where $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are 
\emph{Boolean attributes} and $\approx$ is a \emph{4ft-quantifier}.
The quantifier is computed on the basis of \emph{4ft-table}, as shown in 
Table \ref{table:4FTcontingency}.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{r|c|c}
		{\b M}        & $ \psi $ &  $ \neg \psi $ \\
		\hline
		     $  \varphi $  &  \ \ $ a  \ \ $    & $  \ \ b \ \  $    \\
		\hline
		   $ \neg \varphi $  &  $ c $    & $ d $    \\
		\end {tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{4FT contingency table}
	\label{table:4FTcontingency}
\end{table}

A \emph{4ft table} is a quadruple of natural numbers 
\emph{$\langle$a, b, c, d$\rangle$}
so that: $a$ is the number of object from the data matrix satisfying $\varphi$ and 
$\psi$ (likewise for other numbers). 

The \emph{above average dependence} quantifier is example of such. It is defined 
by the following condition:
$$\frac{a}{a+b}\geq(1+p)\frac{a+c}{a+b+c+d} \wedge a \leq Base$$
where $p$ and $Base$ are user-defined parameters. It can be verbally interpreted
as \emph{Among object satisfying $\varphi$, there are at least 100p per cent 
more objects satisfying $\psi$ then among all observed objects and there are
at least Base observed objects satisfying $\varphi$ and $\psi$.}

\subsection{Virtual attributes}
\label{section:attributes}

We explain our method on following example: there are two tables concerning clients
of a bank. The master table contains information about clients' accounts and the detail 
table contains information about transactions of individual clients\footnote{The
example was greatly inspired by data describing clients of virtual bank Barbora. The
dataset was examined e.g. during the PKDD 1999 Discovery challenge, see 
\url{http://lisp.vse.cz/challenge}.}. One client in the master table can have several transactions in the detail table.

\emph{Virtual attributes} are attributes from detail data tables, that are created
during the process of association rules verification and are treated as normal attributes
of master table although not physically stored. The Ferda system allows creation of
two types of \emph{virtual attributes}: \emph{aggregation attributes} and \emph{hypotheses
attributes}. 

\emph{Aggregation attributes} can be created as SQL aggregations over
a detail table. Attribute stating the average amount of money transfered by a client
is an example of \emph{aggregation attribute}. We will not focus on \emph{aggregation
attributes}, because they can be also imported into the master data table by corresponding
SQL transformations.

\emph{Hypotheses attributes} are of more interest. Their values represent validity of 
generalized association rules on detail data tables. Those values form a virtual 
attribute that is added to the main data table. Example of such attribute can be
\emph{client that often
pays by credit card}, which can be formally written as 
$$ClientID \approx Payment(CreditCard)$$
with a suitable \emph{4ft-quantifier} $\approx$. It is obvious, that this rule
may be very useful to use in the master table concerning clients' accounts. We
name the \emph{virtual attribute} $ClientPayingByCreditCard$. Then one can 
examine status of a client based on client's payments and address. Example of
such generalized association rule is
$$District(SouthEast) \& ClientPayingByCreditCard$$
$$\approx Status(good)$$
Note that these types of rules cannot be obtained by any other method mentioned in
section \ref{section:introduction}.

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{Example of multirelational task setting}
\label{fig:transactions}
\end{figure}

As we have said earlier, \emph{hypotheses attributes} represent validity of generalized 
association rules on detail data tables. The validity of the rules is not computed
for the whole detail table at once but rather for those objects of the detail
table that are in relation with the object from the main data table one by one. This is achieved by dividing the detail table rows into groups corresponding with each
object from the main table and for each such group, the validity of the association
rule on it is returned, generally, as a real number. Figure x represents this
situation. In current implementation in Ferda,
the true/false value for each group of detail table rows is returned (association rule
can be either valid or invalid). As the count of these groups corresponds to count of
objects in the main data table, hypotheses attribute gives us exactly new columns for
the main data table.

Issues concerning \emph{hypotheses attributes} by far exceed the scope of this paper.
As well as WARMR, construction of \emph{hypotheses attributes} suffer from explosion
of hypotheses space. \cite{Karban} gives more information about this problem. 
Interpretation of \emph{hypotheses attributes} poses another issue. Vast
majority of association rules created from the detail data table are not interpretable
within the master data table. Yet there are some constrains according to which
interpretable rules can be created. The matter is at present under research. 

\section{The Ferda DataMiner}
\label{section:ferda}
Ferda DataMiner\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/ferda}} (or Ferda)
is the newest system implementing the GUHA method\cite{GUHA1, GUHA2}.
It envolved from the older \emph{LISp--Miner} 
system\footnote{\url{http://lispminer.vse.cz}}. 

Apart from implementing 4FT, procedure for mining generalized association
rules (as described in section \ref{section:generalized}) and its multirelational 
version, Ferda implements five other relational and one multirelational 
procedures for finding interesting patterns in the data, based on the GUHA 
method. 

One of main features of the Ferda system is visualization of the data mining task
setup. Figure \ref{fig:environment} shows the working environment. User constructs
the task by connecting and setting visual elements called \emph{boxes}. Unlike in
other system, \emph{box} does not represent part of the mining process. It represents
a function, that has input parameters and computes its output. At present, language
of boxes' functions is not recursive, however we are working on a fully recursive
language with standard functional constructs like arrays and $\lambda$ function. 

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{ferda.eps}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{The Ferda environment}
\label{fig:environment}
\end{figure}

Ferda has also some implementation features worth mentioning. The program is written
under GPL license and runs on .NET Framework and Mono. Ferda is a highly modular 
environment, each \emph{box} can run on different computer over the network and can
be written in one of several programming languages. This is achieved by using the Ice
middleware\footnote{\url{http://www.zeroc.com}}. More details on \emph{boxes} 
and implementation of Ferda can be found in \cite{Ferda}.

\section{Demonstrated features}
\label{section:features}

We would like to present the Ferda system, focusing on usage of multirelational 
association mining, mainly \emph{hypotheses attributes}. After short introduction 
of the Ferda environment, we will present various multirelational association
mining tasks. Figure \ref{fig:example} shows one of such. 

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{Example.eps}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{Example of multirelational task setting}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

The \emph{hypotheses attribute} task setting is located in the upper part of the 
figure. The setting corresponds to example of \emph{hypotheses attribute} from section 
\ref{section:attributes}. It examines relations between clients and types of operations (deposit, withdrawal or credit card payment). \emph{Above average dependence} quantifier
is used. 

Lower part of figure \ref{fig:example} shows task setting of the master table. Information
about client's district in conjunction with \emph{hypotheses attribute} are examined 
against status of the client. The setting again corresponds to exemplary association 
rule from section \ref{section:attributes}. Note similar appearance of the master 
table task \emph{box} and also the \emph{hypotheses attribute box} -- they represent 
modifications of the 4FT procedure.
$$$$
We would also like to present, how \emph{hypotheses attribute} setting can affect
the hypotheses space and thus the running times. So far, our experiments have been
based on examining the Barbora dataset. This dataset contains only generated data, 
so observed rules are not relevant in the real world. We will try to find another
source of data and mine interesting multirelational rules. After the implementation,
we also encountered problems with interpreting multirelational rules and with 
setting of intepretable tasks. The issue is a matter of research and by the time 
of the conference, we should bring findings. 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
Multirelational association mining brings more natural way of working with data mining tasks
on complex data. It generalizes the concept of GUHA association rules by widening the definition
of the attribute values to the results of the data mining tasks run on the subset of rows of tables
related to the main table. This approach enables mining for patterns that could not be mined for by
non-relational procedures.

Main drawbacks are the result interpretation and computational complexity. Working with implementation
of hypotheses virtual attribute in Ferda DataMiner has helped to define some concrete issues with virtual
attribute output. These issues are being actively discussed and will be addressed in the next implementation
of relational extensions in Ferda DataMiner.

Computational complexity and resulting performance drawbacks can be addressed by distributing the computations
among different nodes. This solution has been touched by Tomáš Karban. In future, this approach can be
implemented in Ferda as well, as Ferda supports distributed computations thanks to its architecture.
